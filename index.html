        <p>Canada is warm in summer, and even has a desert, yet has vast amounts od snow in the winter. One day you could be enjoying a slightly chilly evening, and  wake up the next day to find -20 degree weater and knee-deep snow. The climate gets kind of wonky every now and then, but if you're the kind of person who wants a little taste of everything, then Canada is for you. As some parts are in the polar reigons, you may find it a miracle to wake up to a 30 degree summer day.</p>
